Currently only available for EURUSD M15.

Why only M15, you may ask? Well it's because I'm a developing Photon trader. In our approach there's something called the "Tricky Change of Character" situation or "One-candle Change of Character". It's only resolved by going to a timeframe lower than the 4h (preferably 15m) and looking to see how price actually moved. So I didn't deem it necessary to add other timeframes. As I'm learning too, I only use one currency pair (EURUSD).

I'll take this as my God-given opportunity to sharpen my almost non existent web dev skills lol. (I only know Python as I code as a hobby, JavaScript is a weak point for me)

I'll soon add the python script i use in parsing/converting data for use with lightweight-charts.
